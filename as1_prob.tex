\section {Probability} 
\begin {enumerate}

\item[1.] The random variable $X$ has the following probability distribution where $a$ and $b$ area some constants:\\ \\
	\begin {tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
	\hline
	$X$ & $1$ & $2$ & $3$ & $4$ & $5$\\
	\hline
	$P(X)$ & $0.2$ & $a$ & $a$ & $0.2$ & $b$\\
	\hline
	\end {tabular}\\ \\
If the mean $E(X) = 3$, then find values of $a$ and $b$ and hence determine $P(X\geq3)$. 

\item [2.] A departmental store sends bills to charge its customers once a month bill in time. The store also found that $70\%$ of its customers pay their first month bill in time has the probability of $0.8$ of paying in time next month and the customer who doesn't pay in time has the probability of $0.4$ of paying in time the next month.\\Based on the above information, answer the following questions:
\begin {enumerate}
\item[(i)] Let $E_1$ and $E_2$ respectively denote the event of customer paying or not paying the first month bill in time.\\ Find $P(E_1)$, $P(E_2)$.
\item[(ii)] Let $A$ denotes the event of customer paying second month's bill in time, then find $P(A|E_1)$ and $P(A|E)$.

\item[(iii)] Find the probability of customer paying second month's bill in time.
\item[(iv)] Find the probability of customer paying first month's bill in time if it is found that customer has paid the second month's bill in time.
